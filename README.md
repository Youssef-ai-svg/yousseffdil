  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a multiplatform development student from Spain with a strong proficiency in several programming languages.
  I also have expertise in UI/UX design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. My passion for graphic design extends into my free time, where I enjoy editing videos and creating immersive worlds using 3d software. Through these 
  creative pursuits, I've not only honed my technical skills but also cultivated a mindset of continuous growth and learning.

  Beyond technical proficiency, I'm committed to personal development and strive to embrace new challenges with enthusiasm. I firmly believe that every project, whether it's coding a new feature or refining a design, offers  
  an opportunity for growth and innovation.
  I'm eager to apply my skills and continue learning in the dynamic field of software development and design, while fostering personal and professional growth along the way.</p>
